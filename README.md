Measuring NS structure with third generation detectors

An example with 9 BNS systems and the ET-D noise curve (SNR~130 per event) is available in the directory et10bns:
 * [Likelihood](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/benjaminlackey/bnsthirdgeneration/blob/master/et10bns/output/pseudolikelihood.html) for each BNS system.
 * [Output page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/benjaminlackey/bnsthirdgeneration/blob/master/et10bns/output/eos_output_page.html) for measured EOS parameters
